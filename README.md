Latex portion of my Honors Thesis from the University of Arizona, 2013.

I only recently realized that I never uploaded this, so I am uploading my file from 2013. I have not modified them or improved them in any way since 2013, but am uploading them so I don't lose them and that they might potentially help others, though I doubt my latex is of use to anyone.

I compiled this using the miktex latex package, ver. 2.9.4757. I don't guarantee it compiles anywhere else, though I don't see why it wouldn't.

If you just want to read the document and don't care about the latex, a copy can be found here: http://arizona.openrepository.com/arizona/handle/10150/297792
